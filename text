read() attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd into the buffer starting at buf.
In the absence of any errors, or if read() does not check for errors, a read() with a count of 0 returns zero and has no other effects.
It is not an error if this number is smaller than the number of bytes requested; this may happen for example because fewer bytes are actually available right now (maybe because we were close to end-of-file, or because we are reading from a pipe, or from a terminal), or because read() was interrupted by a signal.
